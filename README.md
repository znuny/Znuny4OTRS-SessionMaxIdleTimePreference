Session Max Idle Time Preference
=================
This package contains the functionality to define user based session idle times.

In some cases a part of the agent userbase has access to OTRS via public terminals which are used by other unauthorized users, too. In cases where no manual logout is performed by the agent the session keeps valid for 6 hours (OTRS default, SysConfig 'SessionMaxIdleTime'). This might lead to unauthorized access or to convenience issues for other agents if the SysConfig is changed to a lower value.


**Prerequisites**
